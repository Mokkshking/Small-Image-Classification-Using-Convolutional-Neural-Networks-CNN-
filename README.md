# Small-Image-Classification-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-CNN-
The objective of this project is to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying small images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. With ten distinct classes, ranging from animals to vehicles, this project aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of CNNs in image classification tasks
